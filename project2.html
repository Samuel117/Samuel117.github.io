    <p>For a school assignment, I developed "Pan y Cebolla Demo," a 2D platform video game, from April to June 2023 using Unity and C#. 
        In this project, I was responsible for designing and integrating core gameplay mechanics, including player movement, dash functions, 
        and shooting capabilities. Additionally, I crafted and coded the game's introductory animation.
