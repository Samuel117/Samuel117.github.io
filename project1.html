    <title>¿Por qué la gallina cruzó la calle?</title>
  </head>

    <p>In January 2024, I participated in the Global Game Jam where I developed "¿Por qué la gallina cruzó la calle?", 
        a 2D arcade game created using Unity and C#. My contributions included developing the code for character movement and 
        implementing player respawn functionality. I also designed enemies that actively track the player. 
        Additionally, I incorporated animations for both characters and enemies. 
    </p>

    <p>The project earned recognition from Amber Studio, who awarded us for excellence in narrative, development management, 
        and production, highlighting our team's ability to deliver a compelling and well-managed gaming experience.</p>
