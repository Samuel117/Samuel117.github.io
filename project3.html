    <p>In August 2021, I participated in the "Tu Juego a Juicio Jam 2021" and developed "Knight," 
        a 2D runner video game using Unity and C#.  
        I implemented the physics systems for obstacles, enabling interactions between 
        the player character and the environment. 
        Additionally, I created and programmed dynamic obstacle animations.
