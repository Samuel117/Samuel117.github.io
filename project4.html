    <p>For my high school graduation project, I created "Fix-it," a 2D platform video game using Unity and C# from December 2020 to June 2021.</p>
    <p>Firstly, I designed and implemented the character upgrade screen, ensuring it seamlessly synchronized with the player's progress in real-time. This feature allowed players to enhance their characters as they advanced through the game.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I crafted enemy behaviors, including movement patterns, attack strategies, and player detection mechanisms. These elements added depth to the game's challenges and interactions, keeping players engaged throughout their journey.</p>
    <p>In terms of level design, I meticulously created layouts for all stages, aligning them with distinct thematic concepts. Each level was thoughtfully crafted to provide a unique and immersive experience for players.</p>
    <p>Moreover, I developed movement and attack scripts for the player characters, integrating special attacks that added diversity and excitement to gameplay. These unique abilities enhanced the players' abilities to navigate and conquer obstacles within the game.</p>
    <p>To further enrich the gaming experience, I designed and coded multiple mini-games requiring coordinated keyboard inputs and featuring randomly generated object positions or patterns. These mini-games provided players with additional challenges and opportunities for skill development.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I implemented a binary file-based player data storage system, ensuring that player progress and achievements were securely saved and accessible across gaming sessions. This system enhanced the overall user experience by allowing players to track their advancement and accomplishments within the game.</p>
